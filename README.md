## Project Description

This is a project built for udacity's react ND. The application's state is managed by a redux store and the 'backend' is initialized as initial state in the store so a browser refresh will reset state. One day I hope to use firestore to provide persistant state to the application but for now just building to the specifications.

## Install

use `yarn install` to install dependencies.

## Run

`yarn start` runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Redux Toolkit

This project uses [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) which includes utilties to help create reducers and set up store logic and allows you to write "mutative" immutable update logic.
